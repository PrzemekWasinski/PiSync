# PiSync 

PiSync is a simple device I made to automatically sync and back up my computer science projects from a NAS server to a portable SSD. It features a GPIO button to start syncing on demand, and two LEDs to show the status:

`Green` - Idle

`Red` - Syncing in progress

# Why?

Instead of having to manually copy all my projects from my server to my laptop I can just press a button on the breadboard which starts a bash script which will sync
all the files from the server to my portable ssd which I can then unplug and take with me.
